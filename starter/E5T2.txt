# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
- Snyk: https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/
- Trend Micro Cloud Conformity:
https://www.trendmicro.com/en_au/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-conformity.html

### Example vulnerability
Examples from the scan performed by Snyk:
1. Security Group allows open ingress
2. Load balancer endpoint does not enforce HTTPS
3. Non-Encrypted root block device


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
AWS native tools: ECR, GuardDuty, Inspector, and SecurityHub
Snyk: https://snyk.io/learn/container-security/container-scanning/
AWS Inspector:
  - Amazon Inspector performs security assessments of Amazon EC2 instances
  by using AWS managed rules packages such as the Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures (CVEs) package:
  https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-set-up-continuous-golden-ami-vulnerability-assessments-with-amazon-inspector/

### Example vulnerability
SecurityHub example:
  - EC2.19 Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
AWS GuardDuty examples:
  - Kubernetes API commonly used in Persistence tactics invoked from an IP address on a custom threat list.
  - EC2 instance i-99999999 is probing a port on a large number of publicly routable IP addresses.
AWS Inspector example:
  - Medium	Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- AWS native tools such as Config and SecurityHub

### Example vulnerability
1. MFA is not enabled on root account
2. CMK keys are not rotated
3. Config rule securityhub-alb-http-drop-invalid-header-enabled:
Checks if rule evaluates Application Load Balancers (ALBs) to ensure they are
configured to drop http headers. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if
the value of routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled is set to false.
4. Security Hub example: S3.8 S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled at the bucket-level.
This control checks if Amazon S3 buckets have bucket level public access blocks applied.
