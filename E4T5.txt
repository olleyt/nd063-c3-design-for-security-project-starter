# Additional hardening suggestions to remediate in the CloudFormation templates:
1. enable S3 bucket versioning and MFA on delete for the both buckets
2. enable EBS encryption for the root volume of the web server EC2 instance
3. create VPC endpoint gateway for the S3 buckets
4. enable S3 block public ACLs control
5. enable S3 server access logging
6. enable secure login for the secret recipe bucket using Cognito
